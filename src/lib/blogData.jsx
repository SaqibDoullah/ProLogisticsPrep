      <p>Navigating Amazon's FBA prep requirements can be a daunting task for sellers. With rules constantly evolving, staying compliant is crucial to avoid penalties, delays, and negative customer feedback. In this guide, we'll break down the essential FBA prep requirements for 2024 to ensure your products are ready for Amazon's fulfillment centers.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Barcoding and Labeling</h2>
      <p>Proper labeling is the cornerstone of FBA prep. Every item sent to Amazon must have a scannable barcode. You have two options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manufacturer Barcodes (UPC/EAN):</strong> If your product has a manufacturer barcode and is not a consumable, topical, or expiration-dated item, you can use it.</li>
        <li><strong>Amazon Barcodes (FNSKU):</strong> For most products, especially if you're commingling inventory, it's best to use an FNSKU (Fulfillment Network Stock Keeping Unit) label. This unique barcode links the product directly to your seller account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Key Tip:</strong> Ensure your FNSKU label completely covers any existing manufacturer barcodes to prevent scanning errors.</p>

      <h2>2. Packaging and Protection</h2>
      <p>Amazon has strict packaging rules to protect products during transit and storage. Here are some common requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Poly Bags:</strong> Any product in a poly bag must have a suffocation warning label if the opening is 5 inches or wider. The bag must be transparent and at least 1.5 mil thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble Wrap:</strong> Fragile or glass items must be bubble-wrapped or placed in a protective box to prevent damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Sold as a Set:</strong> If you're selling multiple items as a single unit, they must be packaged together with a "Sold as Set" or "Ready to Ship" label.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Expiration-Dated Products</h2>
      <p>For products with an expiration date (e.g., groceries, supplements, beauty products), you must follow specific guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The expiration date must be displayed in MM-DD-YYYY or MM-YYYY format.</li>
        <li>The expiration date must be on the outer packaging, along with the FNSKU label.</li>
        <li>Products must arrive at the fulfillment center with a remaining shelf life of at least 105 days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Shipping and Box Requirements</h2>
      <p>When you ship your inventory to Amazon, the boxes themselves have rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boxes must not exceed 25 inches on any side and must not weigh more than 50 lbs, unless they contain a single oversized item.</li>
        <li>Each box needs an FBA box ID label and a shipping carrier label.</li>
        <li>Use proper dunnage (like air pillows or packing paper) to prevent items from shifting during transit.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Staying on top of these requirements is essential for a smooth FBA experience. By outsourcing your prep to a professional service like Pro Logistics Prep, you can ensure compliance and focus on what you do best: growing your business.</p>
